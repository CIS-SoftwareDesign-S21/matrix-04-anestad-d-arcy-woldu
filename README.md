### What is SIMD, OMP, and MPI? What are the differences between them?


SIMD: Single Instruction Multiple Data is an archetecture where an instruction performs the same operation on multiple streams of data. Threads share one global memory

OMP:  Parallel programs are executed on a local shared memory system. Threads have access to shared data. 

MPI:  Message Passing Interface is mainly useful for distributed system. Tasks are divided and sent between multiple node on cluster. Simple programs can take longer time to execute due to overhead.
